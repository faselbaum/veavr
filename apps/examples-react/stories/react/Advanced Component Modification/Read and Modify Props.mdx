# Advanced - Read and Modify Props

Sometimes it's crucial to know, what props would get assigned by the component you're trying to modify before your modifications are applied. This is where the `.bindProps()` function comes in. It allows you to inspect the part props of your target component and conditionally apply your own props in return.

## Example

We're going to make the following modifications to the `Card` component:

- When an image url is provided through the `img` prop, the card will always adopt the `medium` variant.
- The overlay should always be expanded if the `variant` is `small`.

<SourceCode code={ComponentSourceCode} />
<LiveCodePlaygroundButton
  module={() =>
    import(
      '../../../src/stackblitz-projects/@veavr/react-components/src/components/card-veave-part-props/application.plain.project.generated'
    )
  }
  open="component"
/>

And here is the result of our modifications

<Canvas of={Stories.CardStory} />

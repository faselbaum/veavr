# Advanced - Swapping Parts

veavr components allow you to swap out internal parts. This is useful if you need to insert new elements into the pre-existing markup structure, but it also allows you to hide or replace existing ones.

> Note: The API is still fairly basic but with a few tricks you should still be able to cover almost every use case.

## Example

Last time we added some state to toggle the overlay of our card component. Let's continue there and modify the appearance of the overlay title a bit by adding an arrow icon right next to it. This arrow should serve as visual indicator to the user.

Let's presume we already prepared a replacement component, called `CustomTitle`, for the `Title` part . All that's left to do is to plug it into the `Card` component's `Title` slot and assign any newly required property values to said part.

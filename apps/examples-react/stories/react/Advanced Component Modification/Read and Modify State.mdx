# Advanced - Read and Modify State

Internal state is an integral part of many ui components.
To make components truly flexible it's necessary to grant component users access to this state.
This can be achieved through facilitating veavr's `.bindState()` function.

> Note that `bindState()` in it's current form has been designed to work
> with react state hooks exclusively.
> Support for other state management libraries is planned for later.

## Example

Let's start by introducing some state into our `Card` component.
I'd prefer the overlay to stayed open / closed after the user clicked on it
, as opposed to opening and closing on `:hover`.

<SourceCode code={cardComponentCode} regionNames={['component']} />

And here is the result of our modifications

<Canvas of={Stories.CardStory} />

# Advanced - Swapping Parts

veavr components allow you to swap out internal parts.
This is useful if you need to insert new elements into the pre-existing markup structure,
but it also allows you to hide or replace existing ones.

> Note: The API is still fairly basic but with a few tricks you should still be able to cover almost every use case.

## Example

Last time we added some state to toggle the overlay of our card component.
Let's continue there and modify the appearance of the overlay title a bit
by adding an arrow icon right next to it. This arrow should serve as visual indicator to the user.

Let's first prepare the part to swap out. We're going to replace the `Title` part with a custom component called `CustomTitle`.

<SourceCode code={cardComponentCode} regionNames={['custom title']} />

Alright. Now that we have our custom title prepared we are ready to plug it into the `Card` component.

<SourceCode code={cardComponentCode} regionNames={['component']} />

And here is the result of our modifications

<Canvas of={Stories.CardStory} />

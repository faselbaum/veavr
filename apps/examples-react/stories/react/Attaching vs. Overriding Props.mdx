# Attaching vs. Overriding Props

This section focuses on the most basic feature of weavr components -
attaching and overriding props directly on site using the `$wvr` prop.
We already got a brief look at it in the [Getting Started](?path=/docs/react-getting-started--docs#what-can-users-do-with-this) section.

Click on the **Show code** button on the section below to view the code for the component on display.

## Attach Props

By using the `$wvr.attach` property you can assign properties to parts
which aren't yet assigned by the component internally.
This means you don't run the risk of accidentially overriding properties on parts which
already fulfill a role - potentially breaking some part of the components functionality.

## Override Props

The `$wvr.override` property does exactly what the name implies.
It overrides any property you set regardless of what the target has assigned internally already.
Make sure you know what exactly it is you're overriding here and what it's being used for already
as carelessly overriding properties on a component's parts can easily lead to unexpected behavior.

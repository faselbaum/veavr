# Advanced Component Modification

We covered the very simple use case of statically attaching or overriding props [here](?path=/docs/react-attaching-vs-overriding-props--docs).
Now we'll take a look into weavr's more advanced features offered by the `.weave()` function which is exposed by any weavr component.

## The .weave() Function

A weavr component's `.weave()` function is almost identical to the `weavr()`
function that's being used to build and define a weavr component initially.
It is used to extend a weavr component in a much more fine grained and controlled manner
and create a new re-usable standalone component with modifications in place.

### What Can You Do With It?

- Read and modify properties of any deeply nested part / element.
- Replace any internally used part / component.
- Read and modify internal component state.
- Transform a components public interface.

To showcase each of the mentioned features we will start with a basic
weavr component and slowly **weave** features into it.
Our starting point will be this very simple card component.

<Canvas of={Stories.CardStory} />

And here's the code for it.

<SourceCode code={cardComponentCode} regionNames={['component']} />
